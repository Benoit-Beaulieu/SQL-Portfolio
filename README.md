# Strategy & Operations Sprint - SQL Portfolio
Beginning in late May 2023, I embarked on a 7-week Strategy & Operations sprint with The Commons. 
During the sprint, I had the opportunity to develop my soft and technical skillset, including stakeholder management, ambigious problem solving, as well as data analysis and visualization.

**This repository is a portfolio of my work completed during the sprint using SQL.**

## Core Curriculum 
During the sprint, I was placed on a team of five, simulating the Strategy & Operations team of a high-growth food delivery startup called Juniper. 

Reporting directly the Head of Business Operations, our team was tasked with evaluating Juniper's launch in New York City. Specifically, determining the success of the launch, identify pain points, and produce creative solutions to address them. 

We identified the following areas of concern while evaluating Juniper's launch: 

- Weekly revenue and new customer signups peaked in week-2 of the launch, and have been declining steadily since 

- Delivery times are well above industry standards, with 41% of the total delivery time spent by couriers waiting to pickup orders at merchants

- Order volume is highly concentrated to very few merchants (alcohol vendors in particular) exposing Juniper to revenue volatility 

We put forward the following recommendations to resolve these issues: 

- Improve courier wait times by incentivizing merchants to provide accurate order-prep-time estimate, while harvesting enough data to eventually ship a predictive model

- Optimize Juniper's merchant mix, by continuing to grow the top-5 merchant categories, while sustainably scaling other merchant categories with merchant success programs

For a detailed breakdown of our process, check out our final presentation, [**HERE**](https://github.com/Benoit-Beaulieu/StratOps2023_TheCommons/blob/f5520431684f74a23646988147aa50ad431cac69/Final%20Presentation%20-%20Team%20Rohan%20%20(RoR).pdf)

### Analysis
The majority of my data analysis was fixated on delivery time.I worked with a sub-unit of our team to develop a our three-pronged merchant incentive program to develop a predictive mode. 

The queries I created to conduct the bulk of my analysis can be found [**HERE**](https://github.com/Benoit-Beaulieu/StratOps2023_TheCommons/blob/71886e97d0c47ccb14041698ec6bfaedb969d829/core_curriculum_analysis.sql)

## Additional Problem Sets 
Throughout the sprint, I worked on a number of different problem sets to guide my learning. This addititonal work can be found below: 

- [Question set 1 to 4]()
- [Question set 5 to 7]()

I also completed the [**SQL Fundamentals Certificate**]() offered by [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/path/sql-skills/) to supplement my learning.
