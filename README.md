# Strategy & Operations Sprint - SQL Portfolio
Beginning in late May 2023, I embarked on a 7-week Strategy & Operations sprint with The Commons. 
During the sprint, I had the opportunity to develop my soft and technical skillset, including stakeholder management, ambigious problem solving, as well as data analysis and visualization.

**This repository is a portfolio of my work completed during the sprint using SQL.**
