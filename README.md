# Strategy & Operations Sprint - SQL Portfolio
Beginning in late May 2023, I embarked on a 7-week Strategy & Operations sprint with The Commons. 
During the sprint, I had the opportunity to develop my soft and technical skillset, including stakeholder management, ambigious problem solving, as well as data analysis and visualization.

**This repository is a portfolio of my work completed during the sprint using SQL.**

## Core Curriculum 
During the sprint, I was placed on a team of five, simulating the Strategy & Operations team of a high-growth food delivery startup called Juniper. 

Reporting directly the Head of Business Operations, our team was tasked with evaluating Juniper's launch in New York City. Specifically, our mandate was to determine the success of the launch, identify pain points, and develop creative solutions to address them. 

We identified the following areas of concern while evaluating Juniper's launch: 

- 
- 
- 

We put forward the following solutions to resolve these issues: 

- 
- 

For a detailed breakdown of our process, check out our final presentation, [**HERE**](https://github.com/Benoit-Beaulieu/StratOps2023_TheCommons/blob/f5520431684f74a23646988147aa50ad431cac69/Final%20Presentation%20-%20Team%20Rohan%20%20(RoR).pdf)

### My contributions
The majority of my data analysis was fixated on delivery time. Upon identifying courier wait times as being the largest bottleneck in Juniper's delivery process, I worked with a sub-unit of our team to develop three-pronged merchant incentive program. The goal outcome of our solution was to launch a predictive model, that would improve order pairing and prep-time estimates, so that courier wait-time would be significantly reduced. 

The queries I created to conduct the bulk of my analysis can be found [**HERE**]()

## Additional Problem Sets 
Throughout the sprint, I worked on a number of different problem sets to guide my learning. This addititonal work can be found below: 

- [Question set 1 to 4]()
- [Question set 5 to 7]()

I also completed the [**SQL Fundamentals Certificate**]() offered by [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/path/sql-skills/) to supplement my learning.
